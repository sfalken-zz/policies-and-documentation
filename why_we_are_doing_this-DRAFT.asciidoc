Why are we doing this?

Introduction
------------
[id="introduction"]
$placeholder linux is built on the ideas of using some of the concepts
and tools that we like from various linux distributions.  $placeholder
linux is not being created to *replace* any of it's antecedants, but 
is an effort to combine the strengths of each in a single distribution,
suitable for use primarily as a desktop, or development workstation.

Our primary sources of inspiration are openSUSE and Fedora, both
distributions we have great respect for, and many of the development
team are active in the openSUSE and Fedora developer communities (and
likely will continue to be in the future)

So why not just use Fedora or openSUSE, If you like them so much?
-----------------------------------------------------------------
[id="why"]
Both openSUSE and Fedora are mature distributions, to say the least, 
with thousands of active developers.  And they've got their way of
doing things.  And they are good ways, we're not criticizing (well not
much)   It is just minor things.  We like the rapid development model of 
Fedora, but we also like the Stability of openSUSE. We prefer Zypper to
Yum/Dnf for package management. We like YaST (a lot). We like Fedora's 
policy of keeping the packages in their repositories close to what
Upstream is publishing.  We like the Build Tools that openSUSE has
developed.   Honestly, we love both distributions, we just want the 
things we like from both of them, in one distribution.
