Policy for simple patches

Simple Patch Policy

Goal

This policy is designed to help prevent situations where simple
patches are posted to bugzilla, but end up rotting there because
the maintainer is unresponsive. The goal is to accelerate and
facilitate to application of small but important patches to the
distribution. For situations where the package is out of date or
severely broken, the non-responsive maintainer policy should be
followed.

This policy is designed in particular to avoid situations where
casual users and packagers who encounter a bug and decide to help
out by submitting a fix, end up seeing their patch rotting away.
For people who often submit small fixes to packages across the
distribution, applying for proven packager status is the better
approach.

Typical examples of simple patches

FTBFS issues (preferably with upstream commit if not a packaging
issue)
Problems with Requires/Provides and directory ownership
Incorrect compilation flags (must be well-reasoned)
Small fixes for individual critical issues (crashes, incorrect
behaviour) as well as other other runtime issues (i.e. caused by
changes to another distribution component). Unless these patches
are really trivial and well-reasoned, an upstream commit is
mandatory.
Distribution integration issues (i.e. bad desktop files).
Examples of non-simple patches

Version upgrades
Non-trivial changes for API/ABI issues
Changes to provided subpackages and package names
Feature requests
Anything that requires specific knowledge of the package in
question
Procedure

First, file a bug against the component in question with the
proposed patch. If after one week there was no reply from a
maintainer, start the simple patch process:

Prepare complete patches, for each affected branch, which apply
cleanly against the current tree of the Fedora package. These
patches must also include all the necessary updates to the spec
file (release bump, changelog entry). Make the patch as small and
un-invasive as possible (i.e. no spec cleanups!). Create the
patches with git format-patch and justify the patch in the commit
message. The message must contain references to the upstream
commits if any such exist. Remember to reference the bug in the
commit message and in the spec changelog.
Do scratch builds of the patched package for every affected branch.
Block the SIMPLE_PATCHES tracking bug, and add a comment with the
following contents:
Simple Patch Request
====================
Patch[branch]=<url>
ScratchBuild[branch]=<url>
Patch[otherbranch]=<url>
ScratchBuild[otherbranch]=<url>
Submitter=<FAS id>
A proven packager will review and apply the patch, or reject it
with an explanation.
Note

Any user may file a simple patch request for rawhide, even those
who are not in the packagers group, as long as they have signed up
for a Fedora account and signed the CLA. For stable releases, only
approved packagers may file simple patch requests.

Note for proven packagers

A script to process most of the simple patch request automatically
can be found here process-simple-patch.py.
